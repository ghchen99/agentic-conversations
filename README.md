# AI Podcast Generator

## Overview

This project automates the creation of 20-minute podcast episodes featuring dynamic conversations between an AI expert and various professionals (chefs, teachers, nurses) about AI's impact on their work. Using Azure OpenAI for dialogue generation and Azure Speech Services for voice synthesis, it produces natural-sounding podcast episodes complete with distinct voices for each speaker and professional audio quality. Each episode explores how AI is transforming specific industries through authentic discussions between the host and industry practitioners.

* Azure OpenAI API access
* Azure Speech Services subscription

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_ENDPOINT="your_azure_openai_endpoint"
AZURE_API_KEY="your_azure_openai_api_key"
AZURE_API_VERSION="your_azure_openai_api_version"

â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_generator.py    # Main conversation generation script
â”œâ”€â”€ audio_generator.py          # Text-to-speech conversion script
â”œâ”€â”€ conversations/             # Stored conversation JSON files
â”œâ”€â”€ podcast_audio/            # Generated MP3 files
â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_logs.log     # System logs

```

## Usage

### Generating Conversations

Run the conversation generator:

```bash
python conversation_generator.py
```

This creates JSON files in the `conversations` directory for each profession.

### Creating Podcast Audio

Generate audio from the conversations:

```bash
python audio_generator.py
```

This processes all JSON files in `conversations` and creates MP3 files in `podcast_audio`.
